# React Field Agent Assessment

## Tasks

_TODO_ Add time estimates to each of the top-level tasks

* [ x] Continue working in the repo from last week's Field Agent API repository (#.# hours)

**If your M07 Field Agent assessment is not in a "good" or "stable" state, you can download and use a fresh copy of last week's provided Field Agent API project.**

* [x ] Review the requirements (#.# hours)

* [x ] Identify any research that I need to do (#.# hours)

### Part 1: Project Setup and Agents List

* [x ] Create a new React project with CRA (create-react-app)
  * [x ] Create the project in the root of repo so the folder that's generated by CRA will be a sibling to the API's folder (e.g. `server`)
  * [x ] Name your React project something easily identifiable (e.g. `client`)
  * [ x] Remove the cruft (refer back to the Components and JSX exercise for instructions)

* [ x] Create `Agents` component (stub)
  * [x ] Update `App` component to render `Agents`

* [ ] Update `Agents` to render list of agents
  * [ ] Use `fetch` to `GET` a list of agents from the Field Agent API when the component is first loaded
  * [ ] Write JSX to render the agents array
  * [ ] Stub out click event handlers ("Add Agent", "Edit Agent", "Delete Agent") as necessary

**Make sure that my GitHub repo is updated!**

### Part 2: Add Agent and Delete Agent

#### Add Agent

* [ ] Create a form to add an agent
  * [ ] Add form JSX
  * [ ] Decide between using individual state variables for input elements or a single object
  * [ ] Add onChange event handlers to input elements
  * [ ] Add onSubmit event handler to form element (be sure to prevent the form from submitting!)
  * [ ] Create agent object
  * [ ] Use `fetch` to `POST` the new agent's information to the Field Agent API
  * [ ] On success, update the agents array (don't modify the original array!), or on failure, display any validation errors from the API in the UI

**Note: The format of the `dob` date string that you send to the API must be `yyyy-mm-dd`. Not doing that will result in the API returning a `400 Bad Request` response. The easiest way to ensure correct date formatting is to use a date input element (e.g. `<input type="date" />`) for the "Date of Birth" field.**

#### Delete Agent

_The "Delete Agent" requirement can be implemented one of two ways:_

* [ ] Support deleting agents with no confirmation
  * [ ] Add button click handler to perform the delete (if not done yet)
  * [ ] Use `fetch` to `DELETE` the agent from the Field Agent API
  * [ ] On success, update the agents array (don't modify the original array!)

_or_

* [ ] Support deleting agents with confirmation
  * [ ] Store the "delete agent ID" in a new state variable
  * [ ] Retrieve the agent to delete
  * [ ] Update form state variable(s)
  * [ ] Add delete confirmation JSX
  * [ ] Add button click handler to perform the delete
  * [ ] Use `fetch` to `DELETE` the agent from the Field Agent API
  * [ ] On success, update the agents array (don't modify the original array!)

#### Conditional Rendering (Optional)

* [ ] Conditionally render sections of the component
  * [ ] Add state variable to track the current view
  * [ ] Add conditional logic to the JSX to display the appropriate view

**Make sure that my GitHub repo is updated!**

### Part 3: Edit Agent

* [ ] Support editing agents
  * [ ] Store the "edit agent ID" in a new state variable
  * [ ] Retrieve the agent to edit
  * [ ] Update form state variable(s)
  * [ ] Add form JSX
  * [ ] Add onChange event handlers to input elements
  * [ ] Add onSubmit event handler to form element (be sure to prevent the form from submitting!)
  * [ ] Create agent object
  * [ ] Use `fetch` to `PUT` the updated agent's information to the Field Agent API
  * [ ] On success, update the agents array (don't modify the original array!), or on failure, display any validation errors from the API in the UI

### Part 4: Testing

* [ ] Use the provided test plan to manually test the application

**Make sure that my GitHub repo is updated!**

### Part 5: Bootstrap (Optional)

* [ ] Add Bootstrap to the `public/index.html` file
  * [ ] Add a link to the Bootstrap CSS using the [CDN from the official docs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/#css)
  * [ ] Add the [`container` CSS class](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/layout/overview/#containers) to the `<div id="root"></div>` element

* [ ] Apply Bootstrap styling (as needed)
  * [ ] Update the agents list
  * [ ] Update the add agent form
  * [ ] Update the edit agent form
  * [ ] Update the delete agent confirmation

**Make sure that my GitHub repo is updated!**

## High-Level Requirements

Implement a full CRUD UI for agents.

* Display all agents
* Add an agent
* Update an agent
* Delete an agent

## Technical Requirements

* Use Create React App
* Use `fetch` for async HTTP
* You are not allowed to change the Field Agent HTTP Service or database (unless there's a confirmed bug and your instructor approves)
* Use a CSS framework

## Test Plan

* [ ] Agents
  * [ ] Displays a list of the agents with basic information from the backend service
  * [ ] Includes a button/link to display to the Add Agent view
  * [ ] For each agent, includes buttons/links to display the Edit Agent and Delete Agent views
* [ ] Add Agent
  * [ ] Displays a form for the user to enter an agent's information
  * [ ] Includes a button to submit the form
  * [ ] Includes a button/link to cancel the add operation and return to the list of agents
  * [ ] An agent's information can be entered into the form and when the form is submitted, the agent is added to the backend service
* [ ] Edit Agent
  * [ ] Displays a form for the user to edit an agent's information
  * [ ] Includes a button to submit the form
  * [ ] Includes a link to cancel the edit operation and return to the list of agents
  * [ ] The form pre-populates with the agent's current information
  * [ ] The agent's information can be changed in the form and when the form is submitted, the agent is updated in the backend service

_The "Delete Agent" requirement can be implemented one of two ways:_

* [ ] Delete Agent with No Confirmation
  * [ ] Clicking an agent's delete button in the Agents list removes the agent from the backend service

_or_

* [ ] Delete Agent with Confirmation
  * [ ] Displays an agent's basic information
  * [ ] Displays a delete confirmation message
  * [ ] Includes a button to complete the delete operation
  * [ ] Includes a link to cancel the delete operation and return to the list of agents
  * [ ] Proceeding with the delete operation removes the agent from the backend service
